							<h2>Leveraging AI and UX to Improve Learning and Education for Children with Autism </h2>
						<div class="inner">
							<p align="justify"> My project focused on utilizing AI and UX to enhance the learning and development of autistic children with the guidance of <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/">Professor Bart Selman</a>, a renowned expret in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 
			                                The project focuses on understanding children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), their challanges with social interaction, communication and behavior. Traditional learning methods are difficult for them to grasp and each child needs a specific care as the spectrum is varied. I commenced
								by doing an extensive literature survey to equip with the knowledge of existing technologies and I was surprised to find that most of them employed robots. One of the drawbacks of them is that it could come off intimidating, not cost-effective and there can be malfunctions that can harm the children. 
						</br>
							With this understanding, I designed an application prototype with the help of Figma. The flow of the application is like autism screening with help of AQ-10 questionnaire that was trained with multiple machine learning models like logistic regression, naives bayes, support vectore maching, decision tree and random forest combined for ensemble method to give an accuarcy of 99%. 
							This is followed by a survey to understand the needs of the child and where the caretakers want to improve. Later, in the interface, I aimed to design a road map with recommendation system with different features in the form of games that are designed by keeping in mind about the kids and their needs. 
						</br>
							This is a limited research outcome. I hope to continue this research to produce an effective fully functioning project incorporating additional features based on real-time user research and feedbacks.
