												<h3>Heat Sink simulation</h3>
												<div class="modal-body">
													<p>
														In the world of computing, the race for faster and more powerful CPUs comes with a side effect—heat. 
														As processors work harder, they generate more heat. 
														Prolonged operations at the limits of the operating temperatures degrade the performance or may even damage the CPU.
														Heat sinks and fans are typically used for handling the problem of heating.
														In this report, we consider the Raspberry Pi 4 B, a single-board computer made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

													</div>
													<p>
														A heat sink is a simple yet crucial component that helps dissipate heat from the CPU. Usually made of materials like aluminum or copper, heat sinks feature finned structures that maximize surface area for enhanced heat dissipation through natural or forced convection. When paired with a fan, this combination becomes an effective cooling system.

														and V*=0.329.

													<p>
														Currently, high thrust rocket engines use pressure driven injectors
														due to degree of atomization required in combustion chamber. High 
														thrust engines require very high chamber pressures upto the range of
														250 bars. This leads to having pumping
														pressures of as high as ≈800 bars, which makes the plumbing systems
														extremely complicated. The pressure driven injectors utilize pressure
														energy to atomize, whereas, here, a system is proposed which uses
														rotational kinetic energy to produce turbulence. The advantage of
														such a system is that it is easier to produce very high rotational
														speeds than handling ultra-high pressures across the system.

														Conventional rotary atomizers in the sense that they rotate at very
														high speeds fluid undergo Rayleigh-Taylor instability in radial
														direction, and leaving a jet of fluid in radial direction. These
														jets undergo Rayleigh-Plateau instability to result in droplet
														breakup and result in atomized fluid. Here, it is proposed to induce
														significant turbulence before the fluid streak is formed due to
														Rayleigh-Taylor instability, thereby causing better atomization at
														much lower rotational speeds. This study is aimed at simulating
														Rayleigh-Taylor instability with inherent turbulence and thereby
														studying the performance of such atomizers.
														<br>
														The video above shows the Rayleigh-Taylor atomizer simulated for
														a particular set of inputs. The rotational velocity is not enough
														to creat Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Following are the experimental
														observations of different ratios of rotational speeds to flow rate.
