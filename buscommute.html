							<h2>Design For Making the Wait-Time in Bus Transportation a Positive Experience</h2>
                            <div class="inner">
							<p align="justify">  The experience of traveling from one place to another can often evoke a range of emotions like from being neutral, happy to anxious and even anger. One the top of that having to wait for the transport and it being delayed can just worsen the commute and possibly the day ahead itself. My team and I for our Info 5400 - Qualitative User Research and Design Methods course in Cornell University commonly noticed
                                that the bus transportation, inspite of being mostly used was very unreliable and we wanted to understand the problem better. </p><p align="justify"> We employed Ethnography and Auto-Ethnography method for the same. For our first method we wanted to observe the users from the bus stop and we interviewed them to gain insights into their experiences, preferences, and suggestions. It allowed us to tap into their feelings. </br>
                               <p align="justify"> In our second method, to obtain an hollistic view about this we combined auto-ethnography method with cultural probes method for inspiration. At the end of our user research we restructured and designed a bus stop and an application to assist with positive transportation. 

                               
                            Future works shall include how we can spread this across all the transportation services. </p>
                        </p> <p align="justify"> Additionally, for my NBA 5180 - Design and Innovation course, I designed for the same TCAT (bus transportation in our campus) from the finance and unreliablity point of view (thinking about it now... I think I was probably just too affected by it :p) </p>
